Kauri Pandit is a project to build an agent to play the traditional Indian game known by the many names of Kaura-Baji/Matchi/Pachisi/Chowka-Bhara - (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chowka_bhara). 

The game is played in many parts of the country and amongst diaspora, including many of the homes in our family.
The project is dual-purpose, to practice and further my python skills as well as to work on a game that I'm deeply connected to.

The vision is to build a configurable model, configurable rules based engine, then a heuristic based agent, and finally shift to a learning agent which can accomodate for the various configurations of the game.
